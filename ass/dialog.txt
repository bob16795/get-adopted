//JACK DIALOG - FIRST DATE: BLOCKKRUSTER
<0010><0005><0003><+00>Jack pulls up in a beat-up station wagon, the kind that looks like it's been through a demolition derby. He's wearing an old hoodie that says "King of the Grind" and has a nervous smile, but there's something oddly charming about him. You're not sure what to expect as he parks in front of what appears to be an ancient Blockbuster—or rather, BlockKruster.
<0011><0005><0003><+00>So, uh, I figured we'd go retro tonight. Nothing says romance like picking out a VHS and grabbing a bag of popcorn. What do you think?
<0012><0006><0003><+00>He gestures grandly at the flickering neon sign, clearly proud of his "creative" date idea.

<0016><0006><0003><+00>Inside, the store smells faintly of old carpet and microwaved popcorn. The shelves are lined with faded movie cases, some of which have clearly seen better days. Jack immediately makes a beeline for the action movie section, pulling out a battered copy of Die Hard.
<0017><0006><0003><+00>Now this, this is a classic. You can't go wrong with Bruce Willis takin' on bad guys. What do you think, Tabitha?

//JACK DIALOG - SECOND DATE: LET'S GO GAMBLING!
<0026><0005><0004><+00>Jack drives you to a small, dimly lit casino that looks like it might double as a bowling alley. The sound of slot machines fills the air as you step inside, and Jack immediately heads for the blackjack tables.
<0027><0006><0004><+00>Here's the plan: we go in, we grind it out, and we walk out winners. But, uh... you got any extra cash on ya? Just in case we need a little more firepower.

//JACK DIALOG - THIRD DATE: THE EMPTY APARTMENT
<0038><0005><0005><+00>The third date is at Jack's apartment, which he describes as "minimalist." You step inside and find a barren living space with nothing but a glass-top porch table, two folding lawn chairs, and a single dangling light bulb in the kitchen.
<0039><0006><0005><+00>Alright, so it's not exactly fancy, but it's home. C'mon, have a seat. I'll grab us some beers.

//JACK DIALOG - PROLOGUE: THE SIMPLE LIFE
<0049><0006><0000><+00>Six months later, Tabitha and Jack are still together, living in the same barren apartment. They've added a couch (found on the curb) and a second-hand coffee maker. Life is simple, but it works.
<0050><0005><0000><+00>The only issue? Jack's ex-wife and two kids hate Tabitha.
<0051><0005><0000><+00>You'll never replace me, honey. And those kids? They ain't never gonna call you mom.
<0052><0006><0000><+00>That's fine. I don't need their approval. Jack and me—we're solid, and that's all that matters.
<0053><0006><0000><+00>Darlin', they'll come around eventually. And if they don't? Screw it. It's you and me against the world.
<0054><0006><0000><+00>As the years pass, Tabitha and Jack build a life together, complete with a second-hand dining table and a rescue dog named Lucky. They may not have much, but they have each other—and that's enough.

<0055><0012><0000><+00>As the bus pulls up to the mall here in NotaTownsVille, you feel like maybe this date will be a little different. Finally, a fun place! Most of the creeps you've met so far have only taken you to the local Bogo Burger. Walking into the food court, you spot a large man with his hair pulled back tightly in a hair tie. He adjusts his leather jacket, which is emblazoned with a flaming dragon patch.
<0056><0012><0006><+00>Hello, ma'lady! The name is Sensei McCool, but you can call me Senpai, if you please.

<0065><0013><0006><+00>You have a keen eye, Tabitha. Most people can't see my hidden depths. Beneath this exterior lies a warrior's spirit. Dale * Choppers is just the beginning—this date is going to be legendary!
<0066><0011><0006><+00>He dramatically pulls a pair of sunglasses from his jacket, despite being indoors.

//SENSEI MCCOOL DIALOG - SECOND DATE: GAME STORES AND SNACKIES
<0070><0013><0007><+00>The second date starts at a dimly lit game store that smells like old carpet and way-too-old pizza. Sensei McCool is crouched down in the anime section, inspecting figurines like a raccoon digging through a trash bin.
<0071><0012><0007><+00>This place... it's my temple. These shelves hold treasures that fuel my fighting spirit. You see that limited-edition Vegeta statue? That's the kind of energy I bring to life.
<0072><0012><0007><+00>He stands and brandishes a box of Pocky sticks like they're a sacred offering.

<0077><0012><0007><+00>He pauses dramatically, waiting for her to respond like it's an anime monologue.

//SENSEI MCCOOL DIALOG - THIRD DATE: MOM'S HOUSE
<0082><0013><0008><+00>The third date takes place at Sensei's childhood home—a modest single-story house with a well-manicured lawn and a porch swing. A few garden gnomes dot the flower beds. Inside, the house smells like freshly baked cookies, and Sensei's mom greets you in a neatly ironed apron. She has a warm, Midwestern smile that makes you feel like you've just stepped into a cozy episode of a 90s sitcom.
<0083><0013><0008><+00>Well, hello there! You must be Tabitha. I've heard so much about you. My, you're even prettier than Sensei said!
<0084><0013><0008><+00>She wipes her hands on her apron and offers a firm but motherly handshake.
<0085><0012><0008><+00>Mom, don't go embarrassing me in front of Tabitha! She's a warrior queen, not one of those dime-a-dozen gals.
<0086><0013><0008><+00>He adjusts his jacket awkwardly as his mom chuckles.
<0087><0012><0008><+00>Oh, hush now, Sensei. I'm just being friendly. Tabitha, we're having tater tot casserole for dinner—it's an old family recipe. Make yourself at home, dear.

<0092><0012><0008><+00>Of course I will, Mom! Tabitha and I, we're like two sides of the same katana blade: sharp, balanced, and unstoppable.

<0102><0013><0000><+00>It's been six months since that first date at Dale * Choppers, and somehow, against all odds, Sensei McCool and Tabitha have made it work. Their relationship is an odd mix of adventure and comfort—one part over-the-top anime drama and one part cozy Midwestern domesticity.
//Lester DIALOG - FIRST DATE: THE LIBRARY
<0103><0009><0009><+00>Lester and Tabitha meet at a dimly lit library. Lester, clearly older than his pictures, smiles nervously as he adjusts his outdated blazer.

<0139><0017><0012><+00>The night air is cool as Travis pulls up in his beat-up truck, its muffler rattling like a tin can in a windstorm. He's got a crooked smile, a Marlboro dangling from his lips, and a baseball cap pulled low over his unkempt hair.

//TRAVIS DIALOG - SECOND DATE: CONCERT TIME
<0155><0017><0013><+00>Travis picks you up in his truck, proudly wearing a Limp Bizkit t-shirt with "Significant Other" printed across the back. You arrive at the concert venue, which is more of a dirt field with a stage set up at one end. Limp Bizkit and Creed are on the lineup, and the crowd is already rowdy, with beer cans flying through the air.
<0156><0017><0013><+00>Now this—this is livin', Tabitha! Nothin' beats Fred Durst and Scott Stapp in one night. I hope you're ready to mosh, 'cause I'm goin' all in!
<0157><0018><0013><+00>He cracks open a can of beer and offers you one with a grin.

//IF 0158-0159
<0161><0016><0013><+00>As Limp Bizkit starts playing "Break Stuff," Travis is already in the middle of the mosh pit, yelling along to the lyrics. He stumbles back to you, drenched in sweat but grinning like a maniac.
<0162><0016><0013><+00>Ain't this the best? You ever seen a crowd like this? Just wait 'til Creed comes on—they'll make ya feel somethin', I swear.

//TRAVIS DIALOG - FINAL DATE: EX-WIFE'S HOUSE
<0167><0018><0014><+00>For your third date, Travis drives you to a small suburban house. You hesitate when he pulls into the driveway, noticing kids' toys scattered across the lawn and a minivan parked out front.
<0168><0018><0014><+00>So, uh, this is where I live. Me and my ex-wife, we got an arrangement. It's for the kids, ya know? Don't worry, she's cool with it. C'mon in!
<0169><0018><0014><+00>Inside, the house smells like spaghetti and spilled juice. Travis's ex-wife, a surprisingly friendly woman, greets you from the kitchen while three kids run screaming through the living room.
<0170><0017><0014><+00>You must be Tabitha. Well, good luck, hon—you're gonna need it with this one!
//LINES 0171-0173 ARE PLAYER OPTIONS
<0171><0017><0014><+01>Well, this is... different. Guess I'll stick around and see how this goes.
<0172><0018><0014><-01>You live here? With your ex and your kids? Travis, what the hell?
<0173><0016><0014><-99>Nope. Nope, nope, nope. I'm outta here. (Leave)
//IF 0171
<0174><0017><0014><+00>See, darlin'? You're a real trooper. Most gals wouldn't give me a second look after seein' this setup, but you—you're somethin' special.

<0175><0017><0014><+01>Special, huh? Alright, Travis, let's see if you're worth all this drama.
<0176><0018><0014><-01>Fine, but you're on thin ice, cowboy. Don't push your luck.

//TRAVIS DIALOG - PROLOGUE
<0179><0017><0000><+00>Eight months later, Tabitha is firmly rooted in Travis's chaotic life. The house is louder now, with two more kids added to the mix—Tabitha's and Travis's. The minivan is still out front, but now it's sporting a "My Kid is a Rockstar at NotaTownsVille Elementary" bumper sticker.
<0180><0017><0000><+00>Travis's ex-wife, surprisingly, has become more of a partner in crime than an adversary. Together, they navigate the madness of raising five kids under one roof.
<0181><0018><0000><+00>Well, Travis, you weren't kiddin' when you said I was special. Ain't no other woman who'd put up with all this, but I wouldn't have it any other way.
<0182><0017><0000><+00>And I wouldn't trade you for nothin', Tabitha. Now, let's pack up the kids and hit the next Limp Bizkit show—they're playin' down at the fairgrounds!
<0183><0017><0000><+00>As Creed's "With Arms Wide Open" plays on the stereo, Tabitha smiles. Life with Travis might be messy, but it's hers, and she wouldn't trade it for the world.
