# Dad Connections: The Dad Simulator 2
## The Dad Simulator Sequel no one expected! 

Are you looking to find love? Do you have a strange affection for men with children? Well, do I have the app for you! Introducing - DAD CONNECTIONS: THE DAD SIMULATOR 2. 

An intrecate game with a thorough backstory and unique art style. Meet up to six dad's, and see if they're the right fit for you! This visual novel game includes seven endings, a powerful story, and over 150 unique lines of dialog. Meet lovable characters, like Sensei McCool, and maybe some not so lovable characters...

This project includes a custom data file structure, custom parser for file structure, and over 99 MB of hand crafted assets. Images were created by printing or drawing, then scanning them into digital form. **NO AI TOOLS WERE USED TO CREATE ANY ASSETS IN THIS PROJECT.** Our team included two people with sigifigant programming experience, three artists, as well as a frontend developer with some experience in both. We utalized our specialties to the best of our abilities, assigning our programmers to handle our backend and integration with frontend. Our frontend developer headed our creative development, guiding our artists to create assets in a swift amount of time that both created a charming style and fun game.
